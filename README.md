# Udacity_Communicate_DataFindings


Introduction I have selected the dataset prosper loan data analysis. The dataset contains peer-to-peer loan information for 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan from Prosper Funding LLC. I am going to explore the relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data visualizations.
Variable Selection for Analysis After reviewing the data, I feel the below are most important variables.
BorrowerRate The Borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for the loan. 
LoanAmount : The origination amount of the loan. 
IncomeRange : The income range of the borrower at the time the listing was created. ProsperRating (Alpha):The Prosper Rating assigned at the time the listing was created between AA - HR. Applicable for loans originated after July 2009. 
DebtToIncomeRatio : The debt to income ratio of the borrower at the time the credit profile was pulled. Term: The length of the loan expressed in months. MonthlyLoanPayment:The scheduled monthly loan payment.

## Summary and Findings
In this project, I have tried to identify the correlation between the metrics Loan amount, Monthly loan payments and borrower rating using univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. Also, I have tried to understand how the relationship between the main variables gets impacted when a supporting variable is included in the analysis. I have used “Term “ and “Prosper rating” as my secondary variables. These variables helped me understand the pattern of my key variables better. 
		Through my analysis I have found that there is a strong relation between all my key variables. Loan amount is positively correlated to monthly payments. Higher the loan amount, higher the monthly installments. Also, Loan amount is negatively correlated with borrower rating. This means prosper loan offer better interest rates when customer chooses to get higher loan. Offering better interest rates can help prosper loan, attract more clients.

## Key Insights for Presentation
For my presentation I have chosen loan amount as my key variable and explored its relationship with interest rate and monthly loan payments. Also, to understand a little more, I have introduced secondary variables such as term, income range and prosper rating.  From the further analysis we can conclude that, income range and prosper rating have a positive impact on getting higher loans and better interest rates.
